A spacing between corn plants dataset.
======================================

The adoption of uniform spacing between plants is one of the actions to achieve good grain production indices.

The dataset consists of 188 corn planting images distributed in two classes: tillage conventional (66) and tillage after application of herbicides (122). Each image has an xml file containing information about the image, as a class, time of  purchase, amount of plants, plant spacing in centimeters and plants demarcation coordinates. The base features auxiliary files such as images that represent the demarcation by region, demarcation of boundaries of plants and entire arrays representing the boundaries of the plant.
